# Features

*[Vanilla Reference for Features](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Configured_feature)*

Features are small decorations that modify individual chunks, based on the biome present in that chunk. In TFC, features are all added to biomes via the use of [Biome Tags](../tags/#biome-tags), which means that they can also be added to biomes via the use of these tags.

TFC adds the following features:
